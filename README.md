## About The App
Demo Android App was built to explore JetpackCompose. The main purpose is to display a list of popular and upcoming movies. Also, allows to navigate into a screen with movie details. In order to do that, was used a public API called The Movie Database (TMDB).

Important: this project is Java 17 based.
